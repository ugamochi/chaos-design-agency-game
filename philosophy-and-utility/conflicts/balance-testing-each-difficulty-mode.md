# Fix: Balance Testing for Each Difficulty Mode

## Issue
Balance adjustments might conflict with difficulty multipliers. Need to test balance for each difficulty mode separately. Adjustments might make one difficulty too easy/hard.

## Solution
1. **Test each difficulty mode independently**
2. Document balance values for each difficulty
3. If adjustments needed, apply them to base values, not difficulty multipliers
4. Create separate balance test plans for each difficulty

Test checklist:
- Starting money appropriate for difficulty
- Project payments feel balanced
- Monthly costs manageable
- Burnout/morale decay rates feel fair
- Overall game progression works

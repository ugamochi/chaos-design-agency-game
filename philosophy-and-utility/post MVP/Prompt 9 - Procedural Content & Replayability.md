PROMPT 9: Procedural Content & Replayability

Convert the scripted MVP content into a procedural generation system for infinite replayability.

REQUIREMENTS:

1. Client generation system:
Create random clients with:
- Company name (generated or from list)
- Personality (combine traits procedurally)
- Project type (website, brand, app, etc.)
- Budget range (based on company size)
- Timeline requirements
- Communication quirks

2. Conversation templates: Convert conversations to Mad Libs style:
- Template: "{CLIENT} wants to add {FEATURE}. {REASONING}"
- Variables filled from context
- Maintains humor while being procedural

3. Event probability system:
- Define event types with trigger conditions
- Weight events based on game state
- Ensure pacing (not too many crises at once)
- Some events only trigger after certain milestones

4. Difficulty scaling: Adjust based on performance
- Doing well? More scope creep appears
- Struggling? Easier clients arrive
- Dynamic difficulty maintains tension

5. Unlocks & meta-progression:
- Start future runs with small advantages
- Unlock new client types after seeing certain scenarios
- Unlock team members with unique abilities
- Unlock perks (4-day week, remote work, etc.)

Make the game feel fresh on run 2, 3, 5, 10...

PROMPT 8: Office Visualization (Mini Metro Style)

Add a minimalist top-down office view inspired by Mini Metro aesthetics.

Create a second screen (toggle between "Conversations" and "Office" view) that shows:

- Office layout: Simple geometric shapes
  * Desks: Circles or rounded rectangles
  * Meeting rooms: Larger squares
  * Your desk: Distinct color/shape
  * Coffee machine: Small icon (morale boost location)

- Team members: Colored dots that move between locations
  * Working at desk: Static, subtle pulse
  * In meeting: Multiple dots in meeting room
  * On break: At coffee machine
  * Transitioning: Animated line movement

- Visual indicators:
  * Progress particles flowing from person to project
  * Tension waves when morale is low
  * Celebration burst when project completes
  * Storm clouds when crisis active

- Interaction:
  * Click team member to see status
  * Click project to see details
  * Drag team member to reassign (alternative to menu)

Keep it EXTREMELY minimal - think Zach Gage's aesthetic.

Use only: circles, lines, simple geometric shapes, 5-6 colors max.

Please provide the office view module as a separate system that integrates with existing game state.

# Marketing Agency Simulator: Deep Research & Design Document

## 1. Market Research & Comparable Games

### Direct Comparables

**Card Management Sims:**

- **Reigns** (2016) - Swipe-based decision-making with resource balancing (kingdom, church, military, people). Each choice affects multiple stats. Simple binary choices create complex cascading consequences.

  - *Success factors*: Immediate feedback, hidden long-term consequences, dozens of unique character cards, unlockable storylines, death/restart as core mechanic.

- **Card Shark** (2022) - Not management, but excellent card-based narrative with period-specific scenarios and relationship tracking.

- **Circadian Dice** (2023) - Roguelike card battler with time-pressure mechanics and resource juggling.

**Cozy Management Games:**

- **A Little to the Left** (2022) - Puzzle-based organization game. Cozy aesthetic masks challenging gameplay.

- **Unpacking** (2021) - Passive storytelling through object placement. No failure state, pure vibes.

- **Coffee Talk 1 & 2** - Barista sim with relationship management, recipe experimentation, and branching narratives based on drink choices.

**Studio/Company Management:**

- **Game Dev Tycoon** (2012) - The gold standard. Genre/topic combinations, staff hiring, tech tree, reviews affecting sales.

  - *Critical insight*: Review scores and sales create dopamine hits. Staff have personalities that affect work quality.

- **Game Dev Story** (Kairosoft, 2010) - Mobile precursor. Simplified stats, fast loops, "just one more project" addiction.

- **Software Inc.** (2015) - Deep simulation of software company. Too complex for cozy game reference, but shows market appetite.

- **Mad Games Tycoon 2** (2021) - Expanded Game Dev Tycoon formula with more micromanagement.

**Minimalist Puzzle-Management Hybrids:**

- **Mini Metro/Mini Motorways** - Geometric minimalism, escalating complexity, meditative failure.

  - *Key mechanic*: Each decision creates future constraints. No undo. Pure systems design.

- **Terra Nil** (2023) - Reverse city-builder. Limited tools, creative problem-solving, satisfying cleanup phase.

**Narrative-Driven Job Sims:**

- **Papers, Please** (2013) - THE reference for "boring job made compelling." Moral choices under time pressure, family management meta-layer.

  - *Lesson*: Mundane tasks become meaningful when connected to consequences.

- **Not For Broadcast** (2020) - News director sim. Real-time editing decisions, political manipulation, branching narratives.

- **The Founder** (2016) - Tech startup sim with dark humor about Silicon Valley culture.

**Agency-Specific Games:**

- **Startup Company** (2017) - Software/web company builder. Closer to your concept but lacks personality/humor.

- **Mad Tower Tycoon** (2019) - Tower management but different vertical (office building, not agency dynamics).

### Gap Analysis

**What exists:**

- Cozy games with management elements
- Deep tycoon games for game dev/software
- Card-based decision games
- Job sims with moral weight

**What's missing:**

- **Creative industry chaos simulator** - No game captures the specific madness of client services work
- **Personality-driven project management** - Most games treat workers as stat blocks
- **Scope creep as core mechanic** - This is THE defining experience of agency work
- **Meeting hell simulator** - Tons of potential here
- **The "friend you regret hiring" dynamic** - Untapped comedy/drama gold
- **Pitch/presentation as gameplay** - High-stakes performance moments
- **Revision rounds** - The Sisyphean nightmare of "can you make the logo bigger"

**Market opportunity:**

Huge audience of creative professionals who would recognize and love this. Think how many developers obsess over Game Dev Tycoon. Apply that to the much larger creative services industry.

## 2. Concept Expansion

### Core Pillars

1. **Chaos Management** - You're always slightly overwhelmed
2. **Personality Systems** - Characters aren't resources, they're problems
3. **Client Psychology** - Understanding and manipulating expectations
4. **Scope Creep Physics** - Projects naturally expand unless contained
5. **Creative Burnout Economy** - Quality vs. speed vs. sanity

### Character Trait System

Every person (staff, client, freelancer) has:

**Primary Traits:**

- **Skill Level** (1-5): Junior to Senior
- **Ego** (Low/Med/High): Affects collaboration, takes criticism
- **Reliability** (Flaky/Steady/Robot): Deadline adherence
- **Creative Vision** (Safe/Balanced/Radical): Output style
- **Communication** (Poor/OK/Clear): Reduces revisions
- **Speed** (Slow/Normal/Fast): Work rate
- **Scope Discipline** (Weak/Normal/Strong): Resists feature creep

**Secondary Traits (Random, adds flavor):**

- "Always late to meetings"
- "Brings weird energy"
- "Perfectionist (never finishes)"
- "Yes-man (agrees to impossible things)"
- "Reply-guy (derails email threads)"
- "Conference addict (never in office)"
- "Crypto bro (mentions blockchain unprompted)"
- "Former agency owner (has opinions)"

**Client-Specific Traits:**

- **Budget Reality** (Champagne dreams/beer budget vs. reasonable)
- **Decision Speed** (Analysis paralysis vs. impulsive vs. committee)
- **Taste Level** (Knows what they want vs. "make it pop")
- **Respect for Process** (Understands timelines vs. "it's just changing a color")
- **Payment Speed** (Net 7 vs. Net 90 vs. "check is in the mail")

### Project Anatomy

Every project is a **Card** with:

**Visible Stats:**

- Budget: $5K - $500K
- Timeline: 1-24 weeks
- Scope: Small/Medium/Large/Ridiculous
- Required Team: 2-8 people
- Risk Level: ⭐ to ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Hidden Complications (Revealed During Project):**

- Client has 7 stakeholders (all disagree)
- "One small tweak" requested weekly
- Budget was placeholder, real budget is 40% less
- Decision-maker goes on vacation mid-project
- Competitor launches similar product, requires pivot
- Developer discovers tech stack won't work
- Designer and client have fundamental aesthetic clash

### Event System

**Daily Events (Card Draw):**

- Client email arrives (requires response)
- Team member calls in sick
- Competitor poaches your developer
- Conference invitation (lose team member for 3 days, gain potential client)
- Freelancer becomes available
- Tool/software price increase
- Your star designer gets headhunted
- Former client returns with referral
- Portfolio piece goes viral (reputation boost)
- Bad review on Clutch.co (reputation hit)

**Crisis Events:**

- Client threatens to pull project
- Developer quits mid-sprint
- You forgot a pitch meeting (improvise or reschedule)
- Server goes down during presentation
- Client's CEO overrides all decisions made
- Legal dispute over IP
- Pandemic/recession (all budgets cut)

**Positive Events:**

- Award nomination
- Dream client reaches out
- Perfect freelancer available
- Team member suggests brilliant solution
- Early project completion bonus offered
- Repeat client skips RFP process

### Resource Economy

**Primary Resources:**

- **Money** - Obvious
- **Reputation** - Unlocks better clients
- **Team Morale** - Affects quality and retention
- **Your Sanity** - Personal burnout meter
- **Portfolio Strength** - Attracts clients
- **Network Size** - Generates leads

**Resource Interactions:**

- Push team hard → Money up, Morale down, Quality mixed
- Take on prestige project → Reputation up, Money down (if underpriced)
- Hire friend → Morale up initially, possible disaster later
- Work weekend → Progress up, Sanity down, team loyalty down
- Fire toxic client → Money down short-term, Sanity + Morale up
- Underpromise → Lower scope creep, fewer wow moments
- Overpromise → Higher wow potential, massive scope creep risk

### Progression Systems

**Short-term (Project-level):**

- Successfully deliver project
- Manage revisions (3 included, charge for more?)
- Handle surprise complications
- Balance team workload
- Make micro-decisions (approve design, push back on scope, negotiate deadline)

**Mid-term (Quarter-level):**

- Hire/fire decisions
- Raise rates
- Specialize or diversify?
- Build team chemistry
- Establish processes (reduce chaos but lose flexibility)
- Reputation tier unlocks new client types

**Long-term (Career):**

- Unlock studio upgrades (better tools, remote work, office dog)
- Choose agency identity (boutique vs. volume vs. specialized)
- Mentor system (juniors become seniors over time)
- Exit strategies (sell agency, go in-house, start new boutique)
- Legacy projects (pro-bono work for causes, experimental pieces)

### Difficulty Curve

**Year 1: Survival**

- Few clients, small budgets
- Wearing all hats yourself
- One disaster can sink you
- Focus: Stay afloat, build portfolio

**Year 2-3: Growth Chaos**

- More projects than you can handle
- Hiring too fast or too slow
- Scope creep epidemic
- Focus: Build systems, develop specialization

**Year 4-5: Maturity**

- Reputation unlocks selective client choice
- Team dynamics matter more than individual skills
- Strategic decisions about agency direction
- Focus: Sustainable success vs. ambitious growth

**Endless Mode:**

- Economic cycles (boom/bust)
- Industry trends shift
- Team turnover acceleration
- Focus: Adaptation, legacy building

## 4. MVP Design (Prototype-Ready)

### Absolute Minimum Viable Product

**Tech Stack Suggestion:**

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (or Godot if you prefer)
- Card-based UI library (or hand-code simple cards)
- JSON for all data (easy to mod/expand)
- No art assets needed initially - emoji + colored rectangles

### MVP Scope (One Week Build)

**What's IN:**

1. **5 project types** (website, branding, app, campaign, video)
2. **3 client personality types** (reasonable, demanding, confused)
3. **4 team members** (you + junior designer + mid developer + freelancer pool)
4. **2 resources** (Money, Morale)
5. **Linear timeline** (12 weeks = 1 quarter)
6. **20 event cards**
7. **Simple project progression** (3 stages: kickoff → revisions → delivery)

**What's OUT (for now):**

- Multiple simultaneous projects
- Complex character traits
- Fancy animations
- Sound
- Permanent choices/unlocks
- Quarterly meta-loop

### MVP Gameplay Flow

```
WEEK 1: TUTORIAL
- You're starting your agency

- Accept or reject? (Tutorial forces accept)
- Project has Budget ($10K), Timeline (6 weeks), Scope (Medium)
- Assign team: You + Junior Designer
- Week advances

WEEK 2-3: EXECUTION
- Daily event cards:
  - "Client wants to add feature" → Accept (scope creep) or Push back (risk satisfaction)
  - "Junior Designer struggling" → Help (time cost) or Let them figure it out (quality risk)
  - "Freelancer available" → Hire ($ cost) or decline
- Project progress bar advances each day if team is assigned

WEEK 4: COMPLICATION
- "Client changed their mind about core feature"
- CHOICE:
  - Start over (timeline extends, morale hit)
  - Negotiate compromise (medium impact)
  - Push back hard (risk losing client)

WEEK 5-6: DELIVERY
- Revision rounds (2 included)
- Client requests 3rd revision
  - Charge extra? ($ gain, satisfaction risk)

- Payment received
- Client satisfaction rating (affects reputation)

WEEK 7: NEW CLIENT INQUIRY
- But junior designer is burned out (morale low)
- New project is bigger ($25K)
- CHOICE:
  - Accept and hire freelancer ($)
  - Accept and push team (morale risk)
  - Decline ($ loss, no stress)

WEEK 8-12: REPEAT LOOP
- Trying to balance 2 projects
- Random events keep disrupting
- Resources fluctuate

END OF QUARTER:
- Revenue calculated
- Morale assessed
- SCORE:
  - $ earned
  - Projects completed
  - Client satisfaction average
  - Morale remaining
- High score table
- "Play again?"
```

## 7. Critical Success Factors

### What Will Make This Work:

1. **Recognition Factor**: Creative professionals will see themselves and laugh/cry
2. **Scope Management**: Making "scope creep" a core mechanic is brilliant and unexplored
3. **Personality Over Stats**: Characters feel like real nightmare colleagues
4. **No Perfect Solutions**: Every choice has tradeoffs (like real agency life)
5. **Quick Sessions**: Respects player time (unlike real agency work)
6. **Dark Comedy Tone**: Self-aware about the absurdity of the industry

### What Could Kill It:

1. **Too Much Complexity**: If MVP isn't instantly graspable, it's dead
2. **Not Funny Enough**: Needs sharp writing, not generic corporate simulator
3. **Grind Without Payoff**: Must feel like progress even when chaotic
4. **Missing The Chaos**: If it's too organized, it loses the premise
5. **Wrong Difficulty Balance**: Too easy = boring, too hard = frustrating

---

## 8. Competitive Positioning

**Elevator Pitch:**

*"Papers, Please meets Game Dev Tycoon in a creative agency. Reigns-style card mechanics with the chaos of managing actual humans instead of resources."*

**Key Differentiators:**

- Only game about creative services industry specifically
- Personality-driven chaos > stat optimization
- Scope creep as core mechanic
- Recognizable situations for huge professional audience
- Cozy aesthetic masking stressful gameplay (like Overcooked)

**Target Audience:**

- Primary: Creative professionals (designers, developers, marketers) ages 25-40
- Secondary: Management sim fans
- Tertiary: Indie game enthusiasts who appreciate niche simulators

**Comparable Success Cases:**

- Papers, Please: $4M+ revenue, 70K+ reviews
- Game Dev Tycoon: Unknown revenue but massive success
- Reigns: Multi-million downloads, spawned franchise
- Unpacking: 500K+ copies in first year

**Market Opportunity:**

There are millions of people in creative services worldwide. Even 0.1% conversion = massive audience.

---

## Final Recommendation: BUILD THE MVP NOW

You have a genuinely unique concept here. The MVP can be built in a week with HTML/CSS/JS or Godot. The core loop is solid. The theme is underserved.

**Immediate next steps:**

1. Build the 12-week MVP outlined above
2. Playtest with 5-10 creative professionals
3. Ask: "Would you play this for an hour? Would you pay $10 for a full version?"
4. If yes to both → expand to Phase 2
5. If no → iterate on MVP until yes

The hardest part will be writing sharp, funny event cards. The second hardest will be balancing difficulty. But the foundation is rock-solid.

**This could be special.** The fact that nothing quite like this exists is either because it's a bad idea (unlikely) or because no one's tried it yet (very likely). The creative industry is full of people who would love to play a game that captures their daily madness.

Now go build it.
